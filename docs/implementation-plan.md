# WordGuess Implementation Plan

This implementation plan breaks down the development of the WordGuess game into vertical slices, with each slice delivering a demonstrable feature that builds on the previous ones.

## Slice 1: Basic Game Loop ✅
- ✅ Create game LiveView with static word and basic UI components
- ✅ Implement letter guessing mechanism and game state management
- ✅ Add simple text-based visual representation of word guess progress

## Slice 2: Word Management ✅
- ✅ Create word dictionary module with random word selection
- ✅ Add word difficulty categorization (easy/medium/hard)
- ✅ Implement proper word display with masked letters

## Slice 3: UI Enhancement with DaisyUI ✅
- ✅ Integrate DaisyUI components for game controls and layout
- ✅ Create responsive design for different screen sizes
- ✅ Style the masked word display and used letters

## Slice 4: SVG Word Guess Visualization ✅
- ✅ Design SVG word guess components for different states
- ✅ Implement progressive rendering based on incorrect guesses
- ✅ Add smooth transitions between word guess states
- ✅ Implement a simple incorrect guesses counter

## Slice 5: Virtual Keyboard ✅
- ✅ Create interactive on-screen keyboard with DaisyUI buttons
- ✅ Implement visual feedback for used letters (correct/incorrect)
- ✅ Support physical keyboard input alongside virtual keyboard

## Slice 6: Game Flow Enhancements ✅
- ✅ Add game start screen with difficulty selection
- ✅ Implement win/lose detection and end game states
- ✅ Create game over modal with replay option

## Slice 7: Game Statistics ✅
- ✅ Track game statistics (wins, losses, streak)
- ✅ Persist statistics in database
- ✅ Display statistics in game over screen

## Slice 8: Polish and Additional Features ✅
- ✅ Add word definitions at end of game
- ✅ Implement optional hint system
- ✅ Add DaisyUI theme selection

## Slice 9: Testing Strategy ✅
- ✅ Unit tests for core game logic and word selection
  - ✅ Game logic tests (letter guessing, win/lose detection)
  - ✅ Word dictionary tests (word selection, difficulty categorization)
  - ✅ Game statistics tests (tracking wins, losses, streaks)
- ✅ Integration tests for LiveView interactions
  - ✅ Game LiveView tests (user interactions, state management)
- ✅ Automated test execution with Docker Compose

## Deployment Strategy ✅
- ✅ Configure production environment
- ✅ Set up continuous integration
- ✅ Deploy to production hosting
- ✅ Use Docker Compose for containerized deployment
  - ✅ Database container for PostgreSQL
  - ✅ Web container for Phoenix application
  - ✅ Simple deployment with `docker compose up -d`
  - ✅ Container health checks and automatic restarts

## Current Progress Summary
- Slices 1-9 are fully implemented
- Slice 4 implements a simple incorrect guesses counter for visual feedback
- Slice 6 includes a game start screen with difficulty selection, direct game start on difficulty selection, and a game over modal with replay options
- Slice 7 implements game statistics tracking with database persistence, including:
  - Total games played, wins, and losses
  - Current streak and best streak
  - Win rate percentage
  - Wins by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
- Word lists were updated to have more appropriate difficulty levels:
  - Easy: 3-4 character words
  - Medium: 5-6 character words
  - Hard: 7-8 character words
- Slice 8 adds:
  - Word definitions displayed at the end of the game
  - Optional hint system that reveals the first letter and definition
  - DaisyUI theme selection with multiple themes (wordguess, light, dark, cyberpunk, halloween, forest, aqua)
- Slice 9 implements comprehensive testing:
  - Unit tests for game logic, word dictionary, and game statistics
  - Integration tests for LiveView interactions
  - Automated test execution with Docker Compose
- Deployment strategy is fully implemented with containerized deployment

## Future Enhancements
1. Multiplayer mode with real-time competition
2. User accounts and persistent player profiles
3. Daily challenges with unique words
4. Leaderboards for competitive play
5. Mobile app version with native features
6. Expanded word categories (e.g., science, literature, geography)
7. Accessibility improvements (screen reader support, keyboard navigation)
8. Performance optimizations for larger user base
